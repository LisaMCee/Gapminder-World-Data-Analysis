Gapminder has collected a lot of information about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years,
and on a number of different indicators. 

This repo looks into how the world has changed across these indicators to answer some interesting questions. The analysis process addresses data quality and tidiness issues and goes through, step by step to produce Explanatory Visualizations that answer the questions raised, as the end result.

Data: http://www.gapminder.org/data/

Following are the indicators analyzed:
- **Literacy Rate** <br>
The percentage of people ages 15 and above who can, with understanding read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life.
- **GDP Per Capita** <br>
Gross Domestic Product per person adjusted for differences in purchasing power (in international dollars, fixed 2011 PPP based on 2011 ICP). 
- **Life Expectancy** <br>
The average number of years a new born child would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the same.
- **Employment Rate** <br>
Percentage of total population, age group 15-24, that has been employed during the given year.
- **Forest Coverage** <br>
Percentage of total area that has been covered with forest during the given year; excluding the wooded land, which is spanning more than 0.5 hectares, with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy of 5-10 percent, or trees able to reach these threshold in situ, or with a combined cover of shrubs, bushes and trees above 10 percent. 
- **Human Development Index** <br>
Human Development Index is an index used to rank countries by level of "human development". It contains three dimensions: health level, educational level and living standard. 
- **Population Density** <br>
Average number of people on each square km of land in the given country. 

The analysis is performed in Jupyter Notebooks.
